        Hi, dear user! This is Expressive, your personal blog.
      </h1>
      <p className="about__description">
        As you might already know, here you can create, view, edit and delete
        posts. Along with really pretty UI/UX I hope to give you the best of
        emotions.

        If you are wondering why I have created this: I never really liked UIs
        of any of the task management systems like Notion or Google Keep, too
        dry. So I created this. Personally I use it everyday.
